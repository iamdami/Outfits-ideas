On the day you wear your favorite clothes, take a full-length photo and separate it by hashtag.
For example, #summer, #meeting, ... etc
If you make a hashtag and click it, the corresponding full-length photographs are listed.
You can decide what to wear easily and conveniently by referring to it.

Additionally, the top and bottom can be recognized separately and matched with other clothes.
This could be applied to products from other shopping malls.
When you buy clothes online, you must have thought about whether it would go well with the clothes you have now.
In that case, you can match the clothes you have with the clothes from the online shopping mall using the clothing recognition function.
